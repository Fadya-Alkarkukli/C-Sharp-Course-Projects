# C-Sharp-Course-Projects

Welcome to my **C# Development Repository**! 👋  
This repo showcases my journey learning **C#** and the **.NET Framework** through a series of hands-on projects, exercises, and applications.  
Each project reflects different stages of my growth as a developer — from simple console programs to structured MVC web applications.

## 📘 Overview

Throughout my C# learning experience, I’ve worked on a variety of projects designed to strengthen my understanding of:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class and method design
- Operator overloading and interfaces
- Working with the .NET Framework
- Building web applications using ASP.NET MVC
- Data management through Entity Framework and SQL Server

These projects not only improved my coding ability but also taught me how to structure real-world applications efficiently and cleanly.
